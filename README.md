# LSTM-RNN

This repository focuses on Time-Series Prediction using Deep Learning, specifically Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models implemented in PyTorch. The assignment utilizes a dataset containing information on international airline passengers, with the goal of predicting the number of passengers in units of 1,000 based on the year and month.

Key Objectives:

Data Pre-processing:
Write the dataloader code to preprocess the dataset into PyTorch tensors, employing a library of your choice for efficient handling.

Model Implementation:
Implement two models using PyTorch - one based on LSTM and another on RNN architecture. These models will be trained to predict the international airline passengers' count.

Evaluation and Comparison:
Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics and provide a thorough comparison of their performance. Justify the chosen metrics in terms of their relevance to the prediction problem.

Bonus Points:
Explore ways to improve the prediction results and document them for bonus points.

Future Applications in Robotics:
Explore and suggest potential applications of time-series prediction in robotics beyond the provided example of trajectory estimation for robots. Highlight the versatility of these models in addressing various temporal data challenges within the field of robotics.

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of time-series prediction, deep learning model implementation, and evaluation while encouraging exploration for further improvements and broader applications in the field of robotics.
