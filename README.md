# LSTM-RNN

This repository focuses on Time-Series Prediction using Deep Learning, specifically Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models implemented in PyTorch. The assignment utilizes a dataset containing information on international airline passengers, with the goal of predicting the number of passengers in units of 1,000 based on the year and month.

Key Objectives:

Data Pre-processing:
Built the dataloader code to preprocess the dataset into PyTorch tensors, employing pandas.

Model Implementation:
Implemented two models using PyTorch - one based on LSTM and another on RNN architecture. These models were trained to predict the international airline passengers' count.

Evaluation and Comparison:
Evaluated the models using appropriate metrics and provide a thorough comparison of their performance. Justifed the chosen metrics in terms of their relevance to the prediction problem.

Explored ways to improve the prediction results and document them.

Future Applications in Robotics:
Explored and suggested potential applications of time-series prediction in robotics. Highlighted the versatility of these models in addressing various temporal data challenges within the field of robotics.

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of time-series prediction, deep learning model implementation, and evaluation while encouraging exploration for further improvements and broader applications in the field of robotics.
